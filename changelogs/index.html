		<p><strong><a name="v1_0_2" id="v1_0_2"></a>1.0.2 - March 19, 2012</strong></p>

		<p><b><a name="v1_0_0" id="v1_0_0"></a>1.0.0 - March 15, 2012</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Major Additions/Improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Report files can now have a suffix added to the name of files. The default is &quot;.txt&quot;. This fixes an issue where Microsoft IIS will deny access to files with no extension.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Minor Additions/Improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the selected directory changes (e.g. by clicking a directory, or clicking back/forward in your browser) the directory tree will scroll into view more consistently and without cropping the directory icon.</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b><a name="v1_0rc3" id="v1_0rc3"></a>1.0 RC3 - February 7, 2012</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Major Additions/Improvements:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Added <code>scripts/find.exe</code>. This is a Windows replacement for find.php that fully supports UTF-8 characters in paths. It is also much faster than find.php. It has been tested in Windows XP/7 and Windows Server 2008. Full source code is available via <a href="http://diskusagereport.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/diskusagereport/branches/visualstudio-solution/"><code>branches/visualstudio-solution</code></a> in the SVN.</li>
				<li> Added shell script (find.sh) for using the linux 'find' command in a way that mimics find.php.</li>
				<li> The various forms of 'find' now output a header that includes the column delimiter and directory separator that is used, removing the need to tell process.php.</li>
				<li> Errors encountered during 'find' are now included in the report generated by process.php.</li>
				<li>Added a <code>-fp</code> (full path) option to process.php, which will instruct it to allow the generated report to show the &quot;full path&quot; of the directory as it appeared on the scanned system. By default, this information is hidden in the final report. For example, if the directory scanned was /var/www/html the report would never show the &quot;/var/www/&quot; part of the path.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Minor Additions/Improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> process.php now has -v and -vv options, which display additional info while processing data.</li>
				<li> find.php and process.php now use PHP4 classes.</li>
				<li> process.php reports if the allowed RAM for the script to use is getting low. This should only be an issue if a lot of errors were reported by 'find'. This works in PHP 5.2.1+ or prior PHP compiled with <code>--enable-memory-limit</code>.</li>
				<li> Improved 'skip' messages (in lang/en-us.txt) that appear when the report is still loading, to be a bit more obvious.</li>
				<li> Improved CLI detection in find.php and process.php.</li>
				<li> Disabled the debug timeout (but in a way so that it can be easily be re-enabled).</li>
				<li> Improved detection of file type by find.php, allowing it to detect character/byte devices and fifo pipes.</li>
				<li>Added .htaccess file to the scripts directory for Apache HTTPD.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> [Critical Bug] process.php no longer fails completely when encountering Windows-1252 paths. It now checks to see if a path is valid UTF-8, and if not, it attempts to convert it from Windows-1252 to UTF-8. Only if the conversion fail, does the script fail completely.</li>
				<li>[Critical Bug] process.php failed if the data it processed started with a root directory. An example would be running find.php on &quot;/&quot; or &quot;c:\&quot;.</li>
				<li>[Bug] Language files now use the '.txt' extension because of problems with serving '.json' in Microsoft IIS 6+.</li>
				<li> [Bug] Error count was not being updated properly.</li>
				<li>[Bug] An endless recursion loop occurred when a translation could not be found.</li>
				<li>[Bug] Added better error reporting if the language file fails to load.</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b><a name="v1_0rc2" id="v1_0rc2"></a>1.0 RC2 - June 21, 2011</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A 'packed' version of all the required JavaScript includes is now included and used by default. The original includes are still in index.html but are commented out.</li>
			<li>Added support for HTTP's &quot;Accept-Language&quot; syntax.</li>
			<li>The document title now includes the name of the directory being viewed.</li>
			<li>Errors are better handled when the report is viewed via file:///</li>
			<li>It is now possible to choose between multiple languages by clicking the name of the current language in the footer. However, only English (US) is included by default.</li>
			<li>Upgraded jQuery to 1.6.1 and jQuery UI to 1.8.13.</li>
			<li>[Bug] Top100 paths sometimes pointed to a directory deeper than the file actually resided in.</li>
			<li>[Bug] History did not work correctly in older browsers (e.g. IE6, IE7). Implemented new history functionality based on Google Web Toolkit (GWT).</li>
			<li>[Bug] Some older browers would show &quot;undefined&quot; where translated text should appear.</li>
			<li>[Bug] Fixed example in index.html for using PHP with controller.setLanguage(). It incorrectly used $_GET instead of $_SERVER.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Fixed sorting bug in 'File Sizes' table.</li>
			<li>Added directory tree sorting by &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Size&quot; and &quot;Count&quot;. When sorting by &quot;Size&quot; or &quot;Count&quot; prefixes are added to directory names to show their percent of the parents size/count.</li>
			<li>Reduced size of the &quot;directory&quot; report file by ~30%.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug with UI heights not being recalculated properly after switching to a different directory.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug with directory data (such as &quot;Files Sizes&quot; or &quot;Contents&quot;) not changing after switching to a different directory.</li>
